                        Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a geophysical locating method that uses radio waves to capture
                        images below the surface of the ground in a minimally invasive way. The huge advantage of GPR is
                        that it allows crews to pinpoint the location of underground utilities without disturbing the
                        ground.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        HOW DOES GPR WORK?
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        GPR uses energy waves in the microwave band, ranging in frequency from 1 to 1000 MHz. GPR
                        requires two main pieces of equipment – a transmitter and a receiving antenna. The transmitter
                        sends electromagnetic energy into the soil and other material. Ground Penetrating Radar works by
                        emitting a pulse into the ground and recording the echoes that result from subsurface objects.
                        GPR imaging devices also detect variation in the composition of the ground material.

                        If the electromagnetic impulse hits an object, the density of the object reflects, refracts, and
                        scatters the signal. The receiver detects the returning signals and records variations within
                        them. The GPR system has software that translates these signals into images of the objects in
                        the subsurface. This is how it is used to map structures and utilities buried in the ground or
                        in man-made structures.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        WHAT DOES GPR DETECT?
                    </h5>
                    <p class="toggle">
                        Ground Penetrating Radar signals can be used to find a wide range of items. This this subsurface
                        tool is most effective when there is a large difference between the electromagnetic property of
                        the target and surrounding material. GPR is often used to map items made of the following
                        materials:

                        Metal,
                        Plastic,
                        PVC,
                        Concrete,
                        Natural materials.
                    <p> The possible applications are virtually endless. GPR is frequently utilized to detect:</p>

                    Underground utility lines and pipes,
                    Changes in ground strata,
                    Geological features and rock obstructions,
                    Air pockets or voids,
                    Excavated and back-filled areas,
                    Groundwater tables,
                    Bedrock.

                    <h5>
                        ADVANTAGES OF GROUND PENETRATING RADAR
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        GPR is an extremely cost-effective and non-invasive way of surveying. It provides invaluable
                        information before workers even break ground or start excavating.
<br><br>
                        1) GPR is safe for use in public spaces and a wide variety of project sites.
                        <br>
                        2) It detects metal and non-metal objects, as well as voids and underground 
                        <br>
                        3) It makes it possible to measure the dimensions, depth and thickness of targets.
                        <br>
                        4)Data is provided quickly and can cover a large site area.
                        Only one side of the surface needs to be scanned to provide data.
                        <br>
                        5) Frequencies can be regulated to deliver a range of resolution and penetration depths.
                        <br>
                        6) Data collected during the survey can be seen immediately or used in later projects.
                        <br>
                        7) No digging, excavating, or ground disturbance is necessary.
                        Landscaping, structures, lawns, etc. are be left undisturbed by the survey process.
                        <br>
                        It’s less expensive than other methods.
