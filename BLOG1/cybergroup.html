                        On April 7, Microsoft said it
                        had disrupted cyberattacks from a Russian
                        nationstate
                        hacking group. The group called
                        ‘Strontium’ by the software company targeted
                        Ukrainian firms, media organisations,
                        government bodies, and think tanks in the U.S.
                        and the EU. The Richmondbased
                        company took
                        control of seven Internet domains used by the
                        group to launch their attacks after a court order
                        permitted it to seize the infrastructure. In the
                        past, Microsoft had performed 15 similar seizures
                        to take control of over 100 Strontiumcontrolled
                        domains. Apart from Microsoft, security firm
                        government agencies and individual researchers
                        have been watching the attack group, which has
                        been active for over one and a half decades
                        deploying different attack methods to target
                        individuals and organisations across multiple
                        sectors globally.
<br><br>
                   <h4>   What is Strontium?</h4>  
                        Strontium, also known as Fancy Bear, Tsar Team,
                        Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Sednit or Advanced
                        Persistent Threat 28 (APT28) group, is a highly
                        active and prolific cyberespionage
                        group. It is
                        one of the most active APT groups and has been
                        operating since at least the mid2000s,
                        making it
                        one of the worlds oldest cyberspy
                        groups. It has
                        access to highly sophisticated tools to conduct spy
                        operations, and has been attacking targets in the
                        U.S., Europe, Central Asia and West Asia. The
                        group is said to be connected to the GRU, the
                        Russian Armed Forces main military intelligence
                        wing. The GRUs cyber units are believed to have
                        been responsible for several cyberattacks over the
                        years and its unit 26165 is identified as Fancy
                        Bear.
<br><br>
                       <h4> How does it attack networks?</h4>
                        The group deploys diverse malware and malicious
                        tools to breach networks. In the past, it has used
                        XTunnel,
                        SPLM (or CHOPSTICK and XAgent),
                        GAMEFISH and Zebrocy to attack targets. These
                        tools can be used as hooks in system drivers to
                        access local passwords, and can track keystroke,
                        mouse movements, and control webcam and USB drives. They can also search and replace local fil
                        and stay connected to the network, according to a
                        report by the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre
                        (NCSC).
                        APT28 uses spearphishing
                        (targeted campaigns
                        to gain access to an individuals account) and
                        zeroday
                        exploits (taking advantage of unknown
                        computersoftware
                        vulnerabilities) to target
                        specific individuals and organisations. It has used
                        spearphishing
                        and sometimes waterholing
                        to
                        steal information, such as account credentials,
                        sensitive communications and documents. A
                        watering hole attack compromises a site that a
                        targeted victim visits to gain access to the victim's
                        computer and network.
                        For high volume attacks, the group has used
                        Zebrocy, which is also primarily deployed through
                        spearphishing
                        emails.
                        Fancy Bear has also used VPNFilter malware to
                        target hundreds of thousands of routers and
                        networkaccess
                        storage devices worldwide. The
                        infection allows attackers to potentially control
                        infected devices, make them inoperable and
                        intercept or block network traffic, according to
                        NCSC. More recently, a cybersecurity advisory
                        issued by the National Security Agency (NSA) and
                        the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) noted
                        that APT28 deployed a malware called Drovorub,
                        designed for Linux systems. When deployed on a
                        victim machine, it provides file download and
                        upload capabilities; execution of arbitrary
                        commands; and implements hiding techniques to
                        evade detection.

                   <h4>     Which organisations have been targeted?</h4>
                        The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack
                        during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the
                        global television network TV5Monde cyberattack,
                        the World AntiDoping
                        Agency (WADA) email leak,
                        and several other highprofile
                        breaches are said to
                        be the work of APT28.
                        The DNC was allegedly hacked by Fancy Bear,
                        and documents including emails that were stolen
                        during the cyberattacks were published online.
                        Throughout the campaign, dozens of politicians,
                        DNC staff, speech writers, data analysts, former
                        staff of the Obama campaign, staff of the Hillary
                        Clinton campaign, and even corporate sponsors were targeted multiple times, according to a
                        report by cybersecurity software firm Trend
                        Micro. During the same year, Fancy Bear was
                        suspected to be behind the release of confidenti
                        medical files relating to many international
                        athletes. WADA stated publicly that this data came
                        from a hack of its antidoping
                        administration and
                        management system.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2015, the German federal Parliament,
                        Bundestag, was reportedly attacked by Fancy
                        Bear. During the attack, a significant amount of
                        data was stolen and the email accounts of several
                        MPs, as well as then Chancellor Angela Merkel,
                        were affected. Later that year, the same group was
                        supposedly responsible for accessing and stealing
                        content from multiple email accounts belonging
                        to a small U.K.based
                        TV station.
                        How have governments and security
                        agencies reacted?
                        In 2018, a jury indicted 12 Russian nationals in the
                        DNC hack for committing federal crimes that were
                        intended to interfere with the 2016 U.S.
                        presidential election. The convicts were members
                        of GRU. Later that year, another jury indicted
                        seven defendants, all officers in the GRU. The
                        conspirators included a Russian intelligence
                        hacking team that travelled abroad to
                        compromise computer networks used by
                        antidoping
                        and sporting officia
                        In the U.K., the government had announced it
                        would enforce asset freezes and travel bans
                        against two Russian GRU officers and the GRUs
                        unit 26165, responsible for the 2015 cyberattacks
                        on Germanys Parliament. Besides, the countrys
                        NCSC had issued a detailed technical advisory to
                        assist in detecting the presence of malicious tools
                        used by APT28 on platforms and networks, along
                        with mitigation guidelines for protection against
                        the groups activities.

                        In addition to security agencies, software and
                        cybersecurity firms as well as researchers have
                        published detailed reports, describing Fancy

                        in executing them. This is to help and prepare
                        organisations against the persistent cyber threats
