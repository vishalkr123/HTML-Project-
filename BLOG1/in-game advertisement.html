                <p class="lead">Do black holes still exist?
                    There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies. The presence
                    of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic
                    radiation such as visible light.

                        Black hole, cosmic body of extremely intense gravity from which nothing, not even light, can
                        escape. A black hole can be formed by the death of a massive star. When such a star has
                        exhausted the internal thermonuclear fuels in its core at the end of its life, the core becomes
                        unstable and gravitationally collapses inward upon itself, and the star’s outer layers are blown
                        away. The crushing weight of constituent matter falling in from all sides compresses the dying
                        star to a point of zero volume and infinite density called the singularity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Details of the structure of a black hole are calculated from Albert Einstein’s general theory of
                        relativity. The singularity constitutes the centre of a black hole and is hidden by the object’s
                        “surface,” the event horizon. Inside the event horizon the escape velocity (i.e., the velocity
                        required for matter to escape from the gravitational field of a cosmic object) exceeds the speed
                        of light, so that not even rays of light can escape into space. The radius of the event horizon
                        is called the Schwarzschild radius, after the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild, who in 1916
                        predicted the existence of collapsed stellar bodies that emit no radiation. The size of the
                        Schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass of the collapsing star. For a black hole with a
                        mass 10 times as great as that of the Sun, the radius would be 30 km (18.6 miles).

                        <br><br>
                        Only the most massive stars—those of more than three solar masses—become black holes at the end
                        of
                        their lives. Stars with a smaller amount of mass evolve into less compressed bodies, either
                        white
                        dwarfs or neutron stars.

                        Black holes usually cannot be observed directly on account of both their small size and the fact
                        that they emit no light. They can be “observed,” however, by the effects of their enormous
                        gravitational fields on nearby matter. For example, if a black hole is a member of a binary star
                        system, matter flowing into it from its companion becomes intensely heated and then radiates
                        X-rays
                        copiously before entering the event horizon of the black hole and disappearing forever. One of
                        the
                        component stars of the binary X-ray system Cygnus X-1 is a black hole. Discovered in 1971 in the
                        constellation Cygnus, this binary consists of a blue supergiant and an invisible companion 14.8
                        times the mass of the Sun that revolve about one another in a period of 5.6 days.
                        <br><br>
                        Some black holes apparently have nonstellar origins. Various astronomers have speculated that
                        large
                        volumes of interstellar gas collect and collapse into supermassive black holes at the centres of
                        quasars and galaxies. A mass of gas falling rapidly into a black hole is estimated to give off
                        more
                        than 100 times as much energy as is released by the identical amount of mass through nuclear
                        fusion.
                        Accordingly, the collapse of millions or billions of solar masses of interstellar gas under
                        gravitational force into a large black hole would account for the enormous energy output of
                        quasars
                        and certain galactic systems.

                        L. Ferrarese (Johns Hopkins University) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
                        One such supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, exists at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy.
                        Observations of stars orbiting the position of Sagittarius A* demonstrate the presence of a
                        black
                        hole with a mass equivalent to more than 4,000,000 Suns. (For these observations, American
                        astronomer Andrea Ghez and German astronomer Reinhard Genzel were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize
                        for
                        Physics.) Supermassive black holes have been detected in other galaxies as well. In 2017 the
                        Event
                        Horizon Telescope obtained an image of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the M87
                        galaxy.
                        That black hole has a mass equal to six and a half billion Suns but is only 38 billion km (24
                        billion miles) across. It was the first black hole to be imaged directly. The existence of even
                        larger black holes, each with a mass equal to 10 billion Suns, can be inferred from the
                        energetic
                        effects on gas swirling at extremely high velocities around the centre of NGC 3842 and NGC 4889,
                        galaxies near the Milky Way.

                        The existence of another kind of nonstellar black hole was proposed by the British
                        astrophysicist
                        Stephen Hawking. According to Hawking’s theory, numerous tiny primordial black holes, possibly
                        with
                        a mass equal to or less than that of an asteroid, might have been created during the big bang, a
                        state of extremely high temperatures and density in which the universe originated 13.8 billion
                        years
                        ago. These so-called mini black holes, like the more massive variety, lose mass over time
                        through
                        Hawking radiation and disappear. If certain theories of the universe that require extra
                        dimensions
                        are correct, the Large Hadron Collider could produce significant numbers of mini black holes.
